This script searches and prints out the zones and their related nodes.
This will delete a zone or node depending on which flag is set (-z or -n).
The upper case flag (-Z or -N) needs to be set to the name of zone and node (if used).

The credentials are read from a configuration file in the
same directory named config.cfg in the format:

[Dynect]
un: user_name
cn: customer_name
pw: password

Usage:
This will print out the list of zones & nodes
php znd.py [-l]

This will delete the node "node.example.com"
php znd.py -Z example.com [-n] -N node.example.com
