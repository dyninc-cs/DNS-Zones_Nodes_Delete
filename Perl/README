This script searches and prints out the zones and their related nodes.
This will delete a zone or node depending on which flag is set (-z or -n).
The upper case flag (-Z or -N) needs to be set to the name of zone and node (if used).

The credentials are read from a configuration file in the
same directory named config.cfg in the format:

[Dynect]
un: user_name
cn: customer_name
pw: password

Usage:
This will print out the list of zones & nodes
perl znd.py [-l]

This will delete the node "node.example.com"
perl znd.py -Z example.com [-n] -N node.example.com

This will delete the zone and all of its nodes
perl znd.py [-z] -Z example.com

Options:
-h, --help          Show the help message and exit
-l, --lists         List all of the zone and nodes in an account
-z, --zones         Set the zone to delete
