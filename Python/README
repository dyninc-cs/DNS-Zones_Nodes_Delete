This script prints the Zones and related Nodes for the user's
account. The script will let the user delete Zones from their account.
(Warning: If you delete a Zone in your account you will delete every record
and node under that zone.) The script will also let the user delete nodes 
from their account. (Again if you delete a Node everthing under that Node 
will be deleted.)

The script uses a credentials configuration file that is in the same directory 
named credentilas.cfg with the format:

[Dynect]
user : user_name
customer : customer_name
password : password

Usage: %python znd.py [-l|-z|-n|-N|-Z|-h]

Options:
  -h, --help            Show the help message and exit
  -l, --lists           list the zone and nodes in account
  -z, --zones           zone delete
  -n, --nodes           node delete
  -N NODE_NAME, --node_name=NODE_NAME
                        name of node
  -Z ZONE_NAME, --zone_name=ZONE_NAME
                        name of zone
